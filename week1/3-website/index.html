        <p id="prag">"The story of a man undone by a culture that in part created him,<br> Season of Migration to the North, is a powerful and evocative<br> examination of colonization in two vastly different worlds".</p>

                 believe that if I have contributed anything to modern Arabic Literature, it is in my
                 constant plea for <b>tolerance</b> and this I owe entirely to being a Sudanese”.</li>
            <li> The genesis of <u>Season of Migration to the North:</u> the need to break all romantic
                 illusions about the South/North encounter. It is not a romantic encounter.<br> It is one
                 of confrontation and conflict. A Breakthrough in “orientalist” Literature.</li>

          <h2> <u>Natural Harmony vs Human Confrontations</u></h2>
          <p> Two parallel movements create two basic layers in the novel:
            <ol>
              <li>
                 <u>The natural movement of the elements and animals in the universe:</u><br> birds,
                    vegetation, day and night, heat and cold etc…
                    Presided over by the gigantic symbols which define the Sudan.<br>
                    Desert.......Nile......Equator<br>
                    <em>“Here things begin and things end… The voices of people, birds and animals
                    expire weakly… And the river… flows northwards, pays heed to nothing,
                    a mountain may stand in its way so it turns eastwards, it may happen upon a 
                    deep depression so it turns westwards, but sooner or later it settles down in its
                    Irrevocable journey towards the sea in the north”.<em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Confrontations:</u><br>
                   In contrast with the harmonious movement and countermovement of nature and in
                   nature, is a series of confrontations on the human scale which provoke ruptures of
                   the deepest sort in the souls of men and women who are torn apart between:
                   South/North or more precisely the Arab Muslim Black World and the Western
                   Christian White World.

          <h2> <u>Characters:</u> </h2>
          <p> Three (3) generations interact:
            <ol type="A">
              <li>
                <b>The Oldest</b>, the people who live in “that small village at the bend of the Nile” 
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    <b>Hajj Ahmed</b>, 88, “something immutable in a dynamic world”. <br>
                       - His house? An “extension of the field”, made of “rough sand, black mud and
                       animal dung”.<br>
                       - Himself? “like the sayal bushes in the deserts of the Sudan, thick of bark and
                       sharp of thorn, defeating death because he asks so little of life. That was the
                       cause of wonder, that he was actually alive, despite plague and famines, wars
                       and the corruption of rules”.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                       Bint Majzoub: tremendous zest for life: Totally uninhibited, she remains a
                       traditionalist at heart and cannot understand Hosna’s rebellion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Wad Rayyes:</b> happy-go-lucky, boastful, changing women as he does donkeys! Yet
                       at 70, Hosna resists him, he turns mad and dies tragically.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Mustafa Sa’eed’s father:</b> he comes from a tribe living between Egypt and Sudan.<br>
                       - Unlike Hajj Ahmed, he’s been touched by wars and the corruption of rulers.<br>
                       - He helped Slatin Pacha escape during the Mahdist Revolution. (Slatin Pacha was
                       the Egyptian Governor of Darfour, an Austrian officer in the Egyptian service).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Mustafa Sa’eed’s Mother:</b> from a Southern tribe who sold slaves to the West, i.e.
                       she, as well as the father, has been “infected” by the Colonizer.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>The Middle Generation:</u><br> Grew up under Anglo-Egyptian colonialism in the Sudan and
                   during two world wars in the West. Infected with a deadly disease.
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    <b>Mustafa Sa’eed:</b><br> an orphan, a born outsider setting on a series of migrations to
                       the North with 2 major halts on his way before coming back to the South:
                       Khartoum, Cairo, London.<br>
                       - Who was he? the African God? The black Englishman? Economist, Fabian, Lecturer,
                       Writer, President of the Society for the Struggle for African Freedom, a spy at the Service
                       of the Foreign Office in the Sudan and the Middle East, or what?<br>
                       - The lover of a whole harem, Jean Morris’s husband and Hosna’s.<br>
                       - Who was he? a buffoon, a showpiece, a legend, an invader, a conqueror or the victim of
                       the two worlds in conflict?<br>
                       - “I am the desert of thirst. I am no Othello. I am a lie. Why don’t you sentence me to be
                       hanged and so kill the lie?” 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Sa’eed’s European Contemporaries:</b><br> Summed up at court during his trial.
                       Wearing the mask of justice and mercy, they reenact in the company of Saeed the
                       ritual of colonization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Sa’eed’s harem in London:</b><br> daughters of the icy cold, the girls seek in Saeed
                       “tropical climes, cruel suns, purple horizons”, to cure them perhaps of a
                       thousand-year-old disease.<br>- A cruel parody of colonization on the sexual level.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Sa’eed’s Sudanese Contemporary:</b><br> the embittered Mamur is sure the Colonizers
                       will go on directing the affairs of Independent Sudan from afar.</li> 
                  <li>
                    <b>The “madness” of people:</b> “How strange! How ironic! Just because a man has
                       been created on the Equator some mad people regard him as a slave, others as a
                       god. Where lies the mean? Where the middle way?”

                  <li>
                    <b>The Narrator:</b><br>
                       - Unlike Sa’eed he is “a being with a background, with roots, with a purpose.”
                       Returning to the Village after seven years of studies in London, he feels integrated
                       within the family, his heart flowing with love, his feeling of security being
                       strengthened.<br>
                       - Meeting Sa’eed, will he be infected with “germs” Sa’eed carries in his system?
                       The ambiguity of the relationship: Is Sa’eed narrator’s double, his foil?<br>
                       - Will Sa’eed “Kill” the young man?<br>
                       - No, the Narrator refuses to die, He calls his daughter “Hope” and looks forward
                       to the future.<br>
                       - He returns to tell us his story in the light of Sa’eed’s. It is the story of the
                       educated Arab man in the post-colonial epoch, of the civil servant, fully aware of
                       the corruption of his rulers, his only non-passive gesture is to opt out for life. Will he
                       find his place in “the scheme of things”? Will he be able to help his country? His
                       personality is in the shaping, he bears no name yet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Mahjoub:</b><br> What the narrator would have been had he not left the village.
                       Intelligent, powerful, respected; yet he is frustrated by rural life and dreams of city
                       life. A realist, he accepts the old mentality of the village and does not sympathize
                       with Hosna nor with the narrator’s breakdown.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Hosna:</b><br> The playmate of the Narrator and Mahjoub when they were kids, she
                       changed when she married Sa’eed becoming “like a city woman”.<br>- A stranger in her own village?<br>
                       - Her fatal end.<br>
                       - She is the only tragic figure in the novel. In dignity and with her own blood, she
                       announces the birth of the new Arab woman.
