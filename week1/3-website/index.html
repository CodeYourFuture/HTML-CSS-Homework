  <h1 class="message">Sustaining Diversity & Inclusion in the workplace</h1>
  <p>In an age of increasing technological disruption to business around the world, almost every organization is looking to ways to keep on top of innovation. A classic Forbes study found workforce diversity and inclusion to be a key driver of internal innovation, as alternative perspectives that challenge assumptions and lead to new approaches. Numerous other studies have had similar findings. Diversity has also been proven to be good for business, with a recent McKinsey study finding that gender-diverse companies are 15 percent more likely to outperform their competitors, with ethnically-diverse companies 35 percent more likely to do better.
    However, simply hiring people from different backgrounds – or setting quotas for the number of women or people of different ethnic backgrounds – is not enough to benefit in itself. If your company culture ends up treating all employees in the same way, they will soon become assimilated into your existing working patterns, and the benefits of their diverse perspectives can be lost. </p>

          <h1>Is Diversity & Inclusion Important in the workplace?</h1> 
          <p>People often talk about diversity in terms of both ‘visible’ and ‘non-visible’ categories of difference
            between people; or as ‘inherent’ and ‘acquired’. ‘Visible’ categories of difference include things like
            age, gender, ethnicity, physical disability, pregnancy and maternity; while sexual orientation,
            education, occupational background, political views, religion or belief, some physical disabilities,
            mental health conditions, and socio-economic status are in the less or non-visible category.
            Another angle comes from academic Scott E. Page’s idea of ‘cognitive’ diversity, in other words, the
            “differences in how we see the world, how we think about the world, how we try to solve problems,
            the analogies we use, the metaphors, the tools we acquire, the life experiences we have”.This
            definition can be linked or symbiotic with the above categories of difference. According to Apple's view“The most innovative company must also be the most diverse. At Apple, we take
            a holistic view of diversity that looks beyond the usual measurements. A view
            that includes the varied perspectives of our employees as well as app
            developers, suppliers, and anyone who aspires to a future in tech. Because we
            know new ideas come from diverse ways of seeing things.”

          <h1>How is inclusion different from Diversity?</h1>
            <p>Inclusion is often understood as a more active concept than diversity; the vehicle which enables
            different people to be themselves, express themselves, and realise their full potential, in the same
            workspace. Inclusion is not the same as ‘integration’, and several studies have highlighted
            difference and creative conflict as crucial catalysts in generating the competitive benefits of
            diversity. Inclusion is about putting in place the conditions which enable people with diverse
            backgrounds, insights and experiences to work together openly, respectfully and collaboratively.
            This positive definition of diversity and inclusion opens up exciting new ways of understanding
            how innovation and problem-solving happen in business. </p>

          <h1>Benefits of Diversity in the workplace</h1>
          
          <p>Diversity is an intellect, innovation and success multiplier only when employees work collaboratively. Recruiting professionals from diverse backgrounds are just a step in the right direction.</br> Achieving cohesion in a diverse workforce is what sets the table. Many companies are hiring more diverse genders, races and personalities. Forward-thinking companies are enhancing the inclusiveness of their diverse teams for higher performance. </p>
