          </h2>
          <p> <ol>
             <li>Keep regular sleep hours
                Going to bed when you feel tired and getting up at roughly the same time helps teach your body to sleep better. Try to avoid napping where possible.<br>
              </li><li>Create a restful environment
               Dark, quiet and cool environments generally make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Watch our video for tips on how to sleep better.<br>
              </li><li>Move more, sleep better
               Being active can help you sleep better. These videos can get you going, but remember to avoid vigorous activity near bedtime if it affects your sleep.<br>
              </li><li>Confront sleeplessness
               If you are lying awake unable to sleep, do not force it. Get up and do something relaxing for a bit, and return to bed when you feel sleepier.<br>
              </li><li>Write down your worries
             If you often lie awake worrying about tomorrow, set aside time before bed to make a list for the next day. This can help put your mind at rest.<br>
            </li><li>Put down the pick-me-ups
             Caffeine and alcohol can stop you falling asleep and prevent deep sleep. Try to cut down on alcohol and avoid caffeine close to bedtime.<br>

          <h2 >How Your Body Uses Calories While You Sleep</h2>
        <p>
           During the night, your body goes to work repairing any damage done on a cellular level during your waking hours. For instance, if you exercise during the day, your muscles will recover and repair themselves at night, which requires energy. Food digestion also uses energy, as your body breaks down your meal into usable fuel for the following day.
