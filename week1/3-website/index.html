            Books, books, books. They will increase your lifespan, lower your stress and boost your intelligence. They will give you fuller, thicker hair.
            Whatever the breathless claims about reading, one thing is certain: losing yourself in a great novel is one of life’s most enduring and dependable joys. Job satisfaction comes and goes, partners enrapture and abscond, but you can always fall back on the timeless ability of literature to transport you to a different world. From Jane Austen’s mannered drawing rooms to the airless tower blocks of 1984, novels do something unique. They simultaneously speak to the heart and mind. They teach you about the history of our world, the possibilities of our future and the fabric of our souls.

           <strong>Mustafa's Past</strong><br>
              Mustafa Sa'eed grows up without a father and is raised by an emotionally distant mother. He discovers his cold, sharp intellect in a British colonial school and is given the opportunity to study in Cairo and then in London. Despite the help of kind people, he remains heartless. In England, he embodies white women's stereotypes of an exotic Arab African, seduces them, and then leaves them broken. He has a brief marriage to the only white Englishwoman who dominates and humiliates him until he kills her during a dark sexual encounter. He is tried for the deaths of four women, three of whom die by suicide. After serving time in prison, he returns to Sudan, where he marries a woman in a small village and takes up what by all accounts is a normal, respectable life.<br>
              <strong>The Meeting</strong><br>
              The narrator meets Mustafa after his return from England. He is intrigued by the stranger who inadvertently reveals his knowledge of British poetry. Mustafa tells him about his experiences. During a flood, Mustafa doesn't return home and everyone assumes he is dead. Mustafa leaves his family and property in the narrator's care, along with a key to a secret room in his home. When an elderly man in the village, Wad Rayyes, wishes to marry Mustafa's widow, Hosna Bint Mahmoud, the narrator objects. He has fallen in love with her, but he is reluctant to marry her himself.<br>
              <strong>Hosna's Death and Mustafa's Room</strong><br>
              Despite Hosna's vehement objections and promises to murder anyone who tries to force her to wed, she is married to Wad Rayyes. A few weeks later, the village is awakened by screams. The newlyweds are both found dead. Wad Rayyes has been stabbed many times, and Hosna lies with a knife in her heart. The shocked villagers quickly bury the bodies. The narrator is distraught and regrets his reluctance to marry Hosna. He discovers that Mustafa's secret room is filled with books and British furnishings and is disgusted by Mustafa's hypocrisy and deceit. The narrator decides to go for a swim in the river. He soon finds himself in the middle, unable to reach either shore. Inspired to change his life, the narrator calls for help.<br>

            To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee. Although it was written in 1960 it is set in the mid-1930s in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. It is narrated by Scout Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who lives with her lawyer father Atticus and her ten-year-old brother Jem. During the novel Scout, Jem and their friend Dill try to make their reclusive neighbour Boo Radley leave his house. Boo has not been seen in Maycomb since he was a teenager.
            Many residents of Maycomb are racists and during the novel Atticus is asked to defend Tom Robinson, a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Atticus takes on the case even though everyone knows he has little hope of winning. The reader sees the trial develop through the childlike eyes of Scout, as gradually both she and her brother learn some valuable life lessons from their father about tolerance, empathy and understanding. <br> To read the full story buy the book from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kill-Mockingbird-Harper-Lee/dp/0099549484"> <em>Amazon.</em> </a>
