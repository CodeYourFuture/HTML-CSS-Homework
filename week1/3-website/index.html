                <p>
                  Ahmir Khalib Thompson (born January 20, 1971), known professionally as Questlove (stylized as ?uestlove), is an American 
                 musician and music journalist. He is the drummer and joint frontman (with Black Thought) for the hip hop band, the Roots. 
                 The Roots has been serving as the in-house band for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon since February 17, 2014. 
                 Questlove is also one of the producers of the cast album of the Broadway musical Hamilton. He is the co-founder of the 
                 websites Okayplayer and OkayAfrica. Additionally, he is an adjunct instructor at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded 
                 Music at New York University.

                  The Roots originated in Philadelphia with Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson and Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter while they 
                  were both attending the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. They would busk out on the 
                  street corners with Questlove playing bucket drums and Tariq rapping over his rhythms. Their first organized gig was a 
                  talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that 
                  progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots. Another MC, Malik B., and a permanent bass 
                  player, Leonard "Hub" Hubbard, were added to the band before the release of their first album. In 1992, they dropped 
                  the "Square" from "Square Roots" because a local folk group had claim to the name.
