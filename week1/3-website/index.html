          <p class="main-paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 
              typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
              since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
              make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
              into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
              the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
              recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
              Lorem Ipsum.
