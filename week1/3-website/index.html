          <h2>Introduction: Pre-Bootcamp</h2>
          <p>I have always desired to move into the tech world fully but it hasn't fully materialised. 
            My quest for develoing things lead me to attend a few paid trainings but the focus always 
            shifted for a couple of reasons including lack of direction and no support. No mentor, no 
            proper structure of learning, no road path for personal development. My passion meant I 
            followed a few trainers on YouTube and I end up jumping from one language to another trying 
            to a Jack-of-all trade.</p>

          <h2>CYF Drop-in Sessions</h2>
          <p>Starting off with a taste of coding for the first time was quite daunting. With a hands-on 
            training approach using best platforms particularly FreeCodeCamp began my leap into my life long 
            goal. My first web site "Product Landing Page" was interesting as I could see the outcome of my 
            hardwork on the CodePen editor displayed on the web browser. This first project was closely followed by another web page "A Tribute Page"
