# HTML/CSS Project

## Setup

First step is to fork this repo into your own Github account - if you don't remember how, then refer back Lesson 0 contents.

## Homework

Create a new webpage on a subject that you're interested in (maybe the same topic you used for your Codepen submission).

The page should **NOT** use any framework like Bootstrap.

It should include the following elements:

- The `.html` page and a linked `.css` file applies a consistent color scheme to links and text on your page.
- A page header with a title and description for the site.
- An articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary and a link.
- A page footer containing info about you or the site.
- Proper use of the semantic HTML tags we discussed.
- Research the `:first-child` pseudo-class and use it to style the first article so that it stands out from the others.
- Use this website [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) to generate random blocks of contents to fill your website.
- **Commit often (with good meaningful commit messages), and Push to Github regularly.**
- Use the sketch below to guide you towards the layout and content you are trying to achieve. _Please note that this is just a sketch - you can choose the colours, fonts and images that you want to use in the page._
