        <h1>Rise of Home Office, <br>The Thech behind The Home Workers</h1>
        <div class="blog-main">
            <p><span>Covid-19</span> could permanently shift working patterns as
                companies forced to embrace remote working by the pandemic
                find that their employees do not want to return to the office
                once the closures are lifted.</p>
            <p>The sudden increase in working from home is presenting
                problems as well as opportunities: on the one hand, startups such
                as <strong>Slack</strong> and <strong>Zoom</strong> and established
                giants including Google and Microsoft are offering their tools for free,
                in the hope that people who start using them in a crisis may carry on once
                normality returns. So, let's set forth the tech of home working.* </p>

            <h2><i class="fab fa-slack" style="font-size:50px;color:red;"></i>&emsp;Slack</h2>
            <a id="article-slack"></a>
            <p>Slack, the über workplace management tool, is loved and loathed in
                equal measure, but one thing it has going for it is its free-to-play
                business model: rather than needing to sign up the entire organisation
                at once, it is easy for individual teams, desks and offices to get started
                with the free tier, and expand as they see fit. That means it is best placed
                to help home workers quickly recreate the sort of in-person chat they had in
                the office.</p>

        <article class="article-zoom">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-video" style="font-size:50px;color:blue;"></i>&emsp;Zoom</h2>
            <a id="article-zoom"></a>
            <p>Videoconferencing tools are 10 a penny, but Zoom has impressed many by
                ironing out the kinks in an often-frustrating process. The app lifted its
                limit on free accounts as a response to the crisis, and theoretically supports up
                to 1,000 participants in a single meeting, though it’s unclear whether that’s actually a positive.
                The company has had some controversies, however, from an insecure plugin for Mac clients
                that was fixed in June to a questionable “attention tracking” feature that allows horrible
                bosses to use AI to check whether their employees are actually looking at the screen.</p>

            <h2><i class="fab fa-trello" style="font-size:50px;color:purple;"></i>&emsp;Trello</h2>
            <a id="article-trello"></a>
            <p>Where Slack recreates the feeling of turning to a colleague for a quick chat that’s
                as much personal as professional, Trello is more like your boss walking over to
                “just check on how you’re doing”. The project management software lets teams arrange
                and assign tasks, track wider project progress, and build workflows for repeated jobs – perfect
                for day four or five of working from home, when you might start to wonder if your boss has
                forgotten you exist.</a>
